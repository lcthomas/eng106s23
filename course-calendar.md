# Course Calendar
Readings and other assignments are due – meaning they should be completed – on the dates indicated. All readings except for *Their Eyes Were Watching God* are either linked to here or available via our shared Google drive folder. Please bring a copy of all readings listed for each day with you to class.

The most accurate and up-to-date version of this calendar can be found on our course site. Use the online calendar to check on reading assignments, rather than this print/pdf version, since the print/pdf version of this syllabus will not be updated throughout the semester.

I reserve the right to change the course calendar as needed; adequate advance notice will always be given of any changes.
