Working with your class colleagues on peer review is part of participating in this class. There are 3 designated peer workshop days throughout the semester (the dates are listed above). If you choose to participate in the peer review workshops, you will come to class on those days with a **completed** draft of the writing project we are reviewing. You will exchange papers with a partner (or within a small group), and you will read the work of your partner with an eye toward specific conventions we will discuss in class. You will then give your partner written feedback on their draft that they can use in preparing their writing project for submission to me (and they will do the same for you). The specific conventions you will focus on in your peer review will be listed below before each workshop.

## Participating in Workshops
The number of peer review workshops in which you participate may vary depending on the grade for which you are contracting in this class (though everyone is always invited to participate in each workshop regardless of your grade contract). If you decide to participate in a workshop, you must commit to bringing to class a completed draft of the writing project that is due that day. At the beginning of the semester, the class will vote on the format in which we want to read each other's drafts and provide feedback (print or digital, typed or handwritten).

Here are the number of peer review workshops you must attend in order to fulfill each contracted grade:
* A: 3 workshops
* B: 2 workshops
* C: 1 workshop

## Making Up a Missed Workshop
You should make every effort to attend each workshop in which you decide to participate. Attending the workshop in person is a priority. However, if life intervenes and you are sick, there is an emergency, or you run into other unforeseen and unpreventable problems, you can make a peer review workshop up in one of the 3 following ways:
1. If another student or students also missed class that day and want to make the workshop up, you will exchange papers with them and provide feedback to them outside of class. This is the preferred make-up option and is what we will arrange when possible.
2. You can email your completed draft to me and then schedule a meeting with me in which we discuss it and I give you feedback.
3. You can [make an appointment to discuss your completed draft with a tutor at the Writing Center](https://writingstudies.as.miami.edu/writing-center/index.html){:target="_blank"}.

If you will miss a peer review workshop you need to attend in order to fulfill your grade contract, please email me to let me know you will be gone, and we will arrange one of the above 3 make-up options. Please note that this may also mean extending the due date for your writing project, depending on what we are able to arrange.
