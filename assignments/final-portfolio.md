## Final Self-Assessment
The final self-assessment is about documenting and reflecting on the work you've done to earn the grade you've contracted for. It should include the following things:

1. A brief statement (no more than ~1 paragraph) detailing how you fulfilled the participation aspect of your grade contract. As a reminder, all grade contracts require that you "come to class having completed and prepared to discuss any assigned readings, films, or other media. Participate actively in class activities and discussions, making observations and asking questions that help the class think together."
2. The grade you believe you earned in this class (including +/-), based on how you fulfilled your contract.
3. A brief discussion of the following question: What is at least 1 thing you've learned in this course that you will carry forward with you?

If you would like comments from me on your final portfolio, please indicate that somewhere in your final portfolio/self-assessment.
