# Journal Entries

Your journal entries will be a place for you to work out your thoughts and confusions about the course material and to prepare for upcoming assignments. They are also a way to demonstrate that you are keeping up with the course workload. They will vary in length, but they will usually be quite brief (~1 page). You will write each one in response to a prompt that I will provide, and this page will be updated throughout the semester with the prompts for each journal entry. I will aim to post the prompt for each week a journal entry is due by Sunday evening of that week.

## Journal Entry 1: Due Friday,  January 27
Please complete both parts of this journal entry.

### Part A
In "How to Read Like a Writer," Mike Bunn provides sample questions that you can ask yourself whenever you read a piece of writing to learn how to read like a writer. These questions include:
1. "What is the author's purpose for this piece of writing?" (79)
2. "Who is the intended audience?" (79)
3. "In what genre is this written?" (77)
4. Given a specific passage, what technique(s) does the author use in that passage, and is it effective? (81)

Please answer each of the above questions in relation to Alice Walker's 1975 essay "Looking for Zora." For questions \#1-3, you should answer each question and then write ~1-3 sentences explaining how or why you arrived at that answer. What specific aspects of the essay or of your knowledge of the essay led you to answer each question in the way you did? For question \#4, please select 1 specific passage from Walker's essay and copy and paste or transcribe that passage into your journal entry (please make sure to cite the page number on which it appears in the essay); identify 1 technique Walker uses in that passage; and then explain in no more than 1 paragraph how or why you think this technique is effective.

### Part B
The second part of this journal entry involves writing up your grade contract for the semester. You will contribute in large part to determining the grade you will receive in this course by fulfilling a grade contract. There are no specific formatting requirements for this assignment; you can structure your contract however you would like. However, your grade contract should include the following:

1.	The grade for which you are contracting and the requirements you will meet in order to receive this grade. You can find the requirements for each contracted grade on our [course info & policies page](https://lindsaythomas.net/eng106s23/course-info-policies.html#contract-details){:target="_blank"} under "Contract Details."
2.	A brief discussion of your attendance and participation goals for the semester (no more than ~1 paragraph). How many absences are reasonable and acceptable, given the grade you want to earn in this class and your schedule and other commitments this semester? How do you plan to fulfill the requirement, as it says on our [course info & policies page](https://lindsaythomas.net/eng106s23/course-info-policies.html#contract-details){:target="_blank"} under "Contract Details", to “participate actively in class activities and discussions”? For some examples of what constitutes active participation in class, see [the “Participation” section of the course syllabus](https://lindsaythomas.net/eng106s23/course-info-policies.html#participation){:target="_blank"}. You should seek to challenge yourself but also remain realistic with these goals. For instance, if you often don’t speak in class, you could make it your goal to contribute something to class discussion at least once per week, and/or to come to office hours at least three times during the semester to discuss course material and/or your writing with me one-on-one. Conversely, if you tend to contribute a lot to class discussion, you could make a goal to wait to make your second or third contribution in each class until others who haven’t yet spoken have had a chance to speak. If you find that your class attendance tends to trail off halfway through the semester, make it a goal to miss only 1 class each month, etc.
3.	Any adjustments you already know you would like to make to assignment deadlines. If, in looking at your schedule for other classes and thinking about how you will balance your commitments this semester, you already know that you would like to take an extension on an assignment’s due date (or several assignments’ due dates), this is the place to indicate that. Please state the assignment and your suggested due date. In general, you should aim to submit assignments within a week of their listed due dates, and all assignments to date must be submitted by the two "last-chance due dates" listed on our [course calendar](https://lindsaythomas.net/eng106s23/course-calendar.html){:target="_blank"}. Again, you can also request deadline extensions throughout the semester; this is just an initial plan. See [the “Late Work” section of the course syllabus](https://lindsaythomas.net/eng106s23/course-info-policies.html#late-work){:target="_blank"} for more information on late work.
4. Your 3 writing goals for the semester. We will talk more about this in class, but these should be 3 concrete, specific, and accomplishable goals that you will aim to achieve -- or to be on your way to achieving -- by the end of the semester. They can focus on specific writing conventions, such as, "I want to understand how to use textual evidence more efficiently and appropriately in academic writing," or "I want to learn how to write strong thesis statements," or "I want to learn how to expand beyond the traditional 5-paragraph essay format;" they can focus on you more generally as a writer, such as "I want develop more confidence in myself as a writer," or "I want to learn more about how to successfully incorporate feedback and constructive criticism into my revision process;" or they might focus on you as a student and a thinker more generally, such as "I want to avoid putting off my assignments until the last minute," or "I want to turn all of my assignments in on time," or "I want to develop my skills as an academic researcher by becoming more familiar with how to access and understand academic research." After writing each goal, you should write ~1-3 sentences reflecting on what you plan to do to help yourself accomplish this goal.
